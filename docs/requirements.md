# Accessibility Improvements
## ARIA Attributes
- [x] Add ARIA attributes where necessary for better screen reader support. For example:
   - [x] The ThemeToggle button should use aria-pressed to denote its state.
   - [x] SVGs used as icons should have meaningful aria-labels or title attributes for accessibility.
## Contrast and Readability
   - [x] Test color contrast ratios in both light and dark modes to ensure they meet WCAG AA or AAA standards.
## Keyboard Navigation
   - [x] Ensure all interactive elements (e.g., menu links, buttons) are fully keyboard-navigable.
