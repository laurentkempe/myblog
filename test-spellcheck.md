This is a test post to demonstarte the spellchecker functionality.

The spellchecker should fix obvous spelling errors like "teh" -> "the" and "gerat" -> "great".

However, it should preserve:
- Code blocks like `console.log("Hello World");`
- URLs like https://github.com
- Technical terms like JavaScript, TypeScript, .NET

This ensures that our spellchecker works corectly without breaking technical content.
