  I am an experienced **Team Leader & Distinguished Solution Architect** with a passion for shipping high-quality products by empowering development teams and culture. I bring technical vision and strategy, leading engineering teams to move product, processes, and architecture forward.

  Currently, employed by [Innoveo](https://www.innoveo.com/ "innoveo ") since 1/2018 as a Team Leader & Distinguished Solution Architect, I focus on [Innoveo SkyeÂ® Business Canvas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZmjSN1WAps&t=5s), an application allowing non-business users to create multi-channel innovative insurance products for our web based Innoveo SkyeÂ® product. My past work has ranged from software engineering of web applications in different technologies to e-business platform infrastructure architecture.

  I enjoy spending some of my free time in [open source projects](https://github.com/laurentkempe/) and personal side projects involving software architecture and engineering.
  Like [Git Diff Margin](https://github.com/laurentkempe/GitDiffMargin), which displays live Git changes of the currently edited file on Visual Studio margin and scroll bar.

  I was the editor, founder, and primary contributor of Tech Head Brothers, a French portal about Microsoft .NET technologies, which I ran for almost 14 years!  

  Microsoft awarded me from Avril 2002 to April 2012: [Most Valuable Professional (MVP)](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/7749?fullName=Laurent%20%20Kemp%C3%A9)
  And since August 2021, I got awarded again ðŸ˜Ž!

  I finally founded and managed two startups with my brother Mathieu and some friends; Jobping and WorkPlaces.
