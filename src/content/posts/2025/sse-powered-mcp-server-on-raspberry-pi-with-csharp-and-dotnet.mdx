Now that we explored how to leverage Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to utilize external Tools and AI models in C# applications. Then how to write your own Standard Input/Output (STDIO) MCP server in C# using the modelcontextprotocol / csharp-sdk. Finally, how we can dockerize your .NET C# MCP server to be able to distribute it to be used by AI clients.
It is time to take a step further and explore how to leverage Server-Sent Events (SSE) MCP servers so that we can deploy it remotely, for example on Raspberry Pi.

# Introduction

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol that allows AI models to communicate with external tools and services. It support different transport protocols, including STDIO and SSE. In this post, we will explore how to create a simple SSE-powered MCP server using C# and .NET. We will also discuss how to publish the server so that we could run it on a Rasperry Pi.

# Create a Simple SSE-Powered MCP Server

To create a simple SSE-powered MCP server, we will use the `modelcontextprotocol  / csharp-sdk` library. This library provides a simple way to create an MCP server and support SSE now.

```powershell
dotnet new web -n MCPSSEServer
cd MCPSSEServer
dotnet add package ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore --version 0.1.0-preview.6
```

Open your `Program.cs` file and add the following code:

```csharp
using MCPSSEServer;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services
    // üëá Add MCP Server to IoC
    .AddMcpServer()
    // üëá Register MCP Tool
    .WithTools<TimeTool>();

var app = builder.Build();

// üëá Map Mcp endpoints
app.MapMcp();

app.Run();
```

This code creates a simple ASP.NET Core web application that uses the `ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore` library to create an MCP server. The `WithTools<TimeTool>()` method registers a simple tool that returns the current time, as we saw in all previous posts.
Not so much different from the STDIO MCP server we created in the previous post.

The `TimeTool` class is defined as follows:

```csharp
using System.ComponentModel;
using ModelContextProtocol.Server;

namespace MCPSSEServer;

[McpServerToolType]
public class TimeTool
{
    // üëá Mark a method as an MCP tools
    [McpServerTool, Description("Get the current time for a city")]
    public static string GetCurrentTime(string city) => 
        $"It is {DateTime.Now.Hour:00}:{DateTime.Now.Minute:00} in {city}.";
}
```

# Running the SSE MCP Server

To run the MCP server, you can use the following command:

```powershell
dotnet run
```

This will start the server and you should see the following output:

```powershell
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Hosting environment: Development
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Content root path: D:\projects\tmp\MCPSSEServer
```

We can test the server by sending a request to the `/sse` endpoint using any web browser. And you should see a similar output:

```powershell
event: endpoint
data: /message?sessionId=J6962mKVVKDZYbIiRGT1RQ
```

The MCP server is now running and ready to accept requests. You can use any MCP client to send requests to the server.

# Publish the MCP Server

The `modelcontextprotocol / csharp-sdk` library was made **Native ahead-of-time (AOT) compatible**. This means that we can publish the MCP server as a self-contained, ahead-of-time compiled to native code. These apps can run on machines that don't have the .NET runtime installed. Native AOT applications target a specific runtime environment, such as Linux x64 or Windows x64.

We extend the `csproj` file to add the following properties:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <!-- üëáüèº Enables Native AOT compilation during publish-->
  <PublishAot>true</PublishAot>
  <!-- üëáüèº Favor the size of the executable instead of other performance -->
  <OptimizationPreference>Size</OptimizationPreference>
</PropertyGroup>
```

To publish the MCP server, you can use the following command from a Windows machine:

```powershell
dotnet publish
```

And you will get a single Windows exe file MCPSSEServer.exe of **15.7 MB** üò≤!

To be able to run the MCP server on a Raspberry Pi, we need to publish it for Linux ARM64. To achieve that goal, you need to publish from the Raspberry Pi, because cross-os native compilation is not supported. It should work without any problem, nevertheless, I haven't tested it yet.

# Using our MCP server

To use the MCP server, we can use for example Claude, Visual Studio Code or any other client supporting MCP. You can read more about how to configure both Claude and Visual Studio Code on my previous post [Dockerizing your .NET C# MCP Server for AI Clients like Claude Desktop](https://laurentkempe.com/2025/03/27/dockerizing-your-dotnet-csharp-mcp-server-for-ai-clients-like-claude-desktop/).

# Conclusion

In this post, we explored how to create a simple SSE-powered MCP server using C# and .NET. SSE protocol compared to STDIO allows us to deploy the MCP Server on a remote machine. We also discussed how to publish the server as a self-contained, ahead-of-time compiled to native code. This allows us to run the MCP server on machines that don't have the .NET runtime installed creating quite small executables.
