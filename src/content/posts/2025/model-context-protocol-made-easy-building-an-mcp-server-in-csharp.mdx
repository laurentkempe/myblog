My previous post was describing how we could use C# with `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`, Ollama, and a nice nuget called `mcpdotnet` to be able to call an existing MCP Server. In the meantime, the `mcpdotnet` library has been promoted to an "**official C# SDK for Model Context Protocol servers and clients, maintained by Microsoft**".

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables seamless integration between AI systems and various data sources, allowing developers to create context-aware applications. In this post, we'll explore how to build a simple MCP server using C# and the **modelcontextprotocol / csharp-sdk** library, which simplifies the process of creating and managing MCP servers.

# Introduction

The future of AI extends beyond powerful models to their seamless interaction with the data that drives our world. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a groundbreaking open standard designed to bridge the gap between AI systems and diverse data sources. Developed by Anthropic, MCP simplifies the integration of AI with content repositories, business tools, and development environments. By replacing fragmented, custom integrations with a universal protocol, MCP empowers developers to create secure, scalable, and context-aware AI applications.

# Requirements

* **Llama 3.2 SLM**, a model supporting function calling
* **Ollama** to run the SLM and handle the integration
* A .NET CLI application using **modelcontextprotocol / csharp-sdk** for the server
* Another .NET CLI application also using **modelcontextprotocol / csharp-sdk** for the client

# Create MCPServer .NET Console Application

We'll create a simple .NET CLI application that will server as our MCP Server.

```powershell
dotnet new console -n MCPServer
cd MCPServer
dotnet add package ModelContextProtocol --version 0.1.0-preview.1.25171.12
```

# Implementation an MCP server in C#

Our console application leverages `modelcontextprotocol / csharp-sdk` providing an easy way to create a MCP server using the **STDIO transport protocol**. The library also provides some attributes to define MCP Tools.

<Alert mode="info">
Server-side SSE transport protocol is not supported at the time of writting but it is in development. The client-side SSE transport protocol is supported and can be used to call MCP servers.
</Alert>

We continue with our simplest idea, so we are defining a **Time MCP Server** which exposes a time Tool.

```csharp
var builder = Host.CreateEmptyApplicationBuilder(settings: null);
builder.Services
    // üëáüèº We build an MCP Server   
    .AddMcpServer()
    // üëáüèº uses Stdio as transport protocol    
    .WithStdioServerTransport()
    // üëáüèº Register all tools with McpToolType attribute    
    .WithTools();
await builder.Build().RunAsync();

// üëáüèº Mark our type as a container for MCP tools
[McpToolType]
public static class TimeTool
{
    // üëáüèº Mark a method as an MCP tools
    [McpTool, Description("Get the current time for a city")]
    public static string GetCurrentTime(string city) => 
        $"It is {DateTime.Now.Hour}:{DateTime.Now.Minute} in {city}.";
}
```

We define easily a tool by adding the `McpToolType` attribute to our class and the `McpTool` attribute to our method. The method will be called when the AI model determine that it is the right tool to use following the request from the user.

# Testing the MCP Server

The MCP Inspector is an interactive developer tool designed for testing and debugging MCP servers. It provides a user-friendly interface for sending requests to the server, inspecting responses, and visualizing the interaction between the AI model and the MCP server. The inspector is particularly useful for developers working with the Model Context Protocol, as it simplifies the process of testing and validating MCP server functionality.

We can start the inspector from our application folder using the nodejs command `npx` with the following command:

```powershell
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dotnet run
```

It will run the inspector and start our MCP server. The inspector will automatically detect the MCP server and allow us to test it.

```powershell
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dotnet run
Starting MCP inspector...
Proxy server listening on port 3000

üîç MCP Inspector is up and running at http://localhost:5173 üöÄ
```

Navigate to http://localhost:5173 click on `Connect` then on `Tools` tab and finally on `List Tools`. You should see the `GetCurrentTime` tool we just created and be able to call it passing a city name.

Our MCP server is now working üéâ

# Calling the MCP Server from a C# application

Now we want to call our MCP server from a C# application. We will also use the `modelcontextprotocol / csharp-sdk` library to be able to call the MCP server and get the current time. The code is almost the same as the one we used in the previous post, except the creation of the `McpServerConfig` object which is pointing to our **Time MCP Server** just created.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello, official MCP csharp-sdk and MCP Server!");

var message = "What is the current (CET) time in Illzach, France?";
Console.WriteLine(message);

// üëáüèº Configure the MCP client options
McpClientOptions options = new()
{
    ClientInfo = new() { Name = "Time Client", Version = "1.0.0" }
};

// üëáüèº Configure the Model Context Protocol server to use
var config = new McpServerConfig
{
    Id = "time",
    Name = "Time MCP Server",
    TransportType = TransportTypes.StdIo,
    TransportOptions = new Dictionary<string, string>
    {
        // üëáüèº The command executed to start the MCP server
        ["command"] = @"..\..\..\..\MCPServer\bin\Debug\net9.0\MCPServer.exe"
    }
};

using var factory =
    LoggerFactory.Create(builder => builder.AddConsole().SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Trace));

// üëáüèº Get an MCP session scope used to get the MCP tools
await using var mcpClient = await McpClientFactory.CreateAsync(config, options);

// üëáüèº Use Ollama as the chat client
var ollamaChatClient =
    new OllamaChatClient(new Uri("http://localhost:11434/"), "llama3.2:3b");
var client = new ChatClientBuilder(ollamaChatClient)
    // üëáüèº Add logging to the chat client, wrapping the function invocation client 
    .UseLogging(factory)
    // üëáüèº Add function invocation to the chat client, wrapping the Ollama client
    .UseFunctionInvocation()
    .Build();
    
IList<ChatMessage> messages =
[
    new(ChatRole.System, """
                         You are a helpful assistant delivering time in one sentence
                         in a short format, like 'It is 10:08 in Paris, France.'
                         """),
    new(ChatRole.User, message)
];

// üëáüèº Pass the MCP tools to the chat client
var mcpTools = await mcpClient.GetAIFunctionsAsync();
var response =
    await client.GetResponseAsync(
        messages,
        new ChatOptions { Tools = [..mcpTools] });

Console.WriteLine(response);
```

<Alert mode="info">
The way to configure the command in `McpServerConfig` is not really great. We will see in a future post how to improve that.
</Alert>

To run the application, simply execute `dotnet run`. The client application starts, then starts our own **Time MCP Server**, interacts with the AI model, and returns the current time in Illzach, France.

```powershell
> dotnet run
Hello, official MCP csharp-sdk and MCP Server!

              {
                "$type": "text",
                "text": "The current time in Illzach, France (CET) is 9:08."
              }
            ]
          }
        ],

            "eval_duration": 468492200
          }
        }
      }.
The current time in Illzach, France (CET) is 9:08.
```

The trace logs reveal how the application interacts with the AI model: first, our application send the user message "What is the current (CET) time in Illzach, France?" with the list of tools. Then the LLM replies with a `functionCall` response, indicating that it wants to call the `GetCurrentTime` function with the argument "Illzach, France". The `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` client then calls the tool on the MCP server, which executes the `GetCurrentTime` function and returns a `functionResult` with the value "It is 9:8 in Illzach, France.". Finally, the assistant formulates a user-friendly response based on the function call result; "The current time in Illzach, France (CET) is 9:08.".

If you want to also see trace logs of the MCP client, you can update to the following code to your client application

```csharp
// üëáüèº Get an MCP session scope used to get the MCP tools
// üëáüèº Get an MCP session scope used to get the MCP tools
await using var mcpClient = 
    await McpClientFactory.CreateAsync(config, options, loggerFactory: factory);
```

You would see the following trace logs

```powershell
Hello, official MCP csharp-sdk and MCP Server!
What is the current (CET) time in Illzach, France?
info: ModelContextProtocol.Client.McpClientFactory[77006853]
