Dapr is an impressive set of APIs for building distributed applications with any language and platform. It provides a set of building blocks that you can use to build microservices. Dapr is based on sidecar architecture. Meaning that you need to run a Dapr sidecar for each of your applications. **How do you debug your Dapr apps effectively?** If you have been using PowerShell scripts to run and attach your debugger, you know how tedious and error-prone it can be. Ready to see how to use Rider or Visual Studio to debug your Dapr apps with ease and confidence?
{/* <!-- more --> */}

# Running Dapr application

To run the Dapr application, you need to use the Dapr CLI and define some parameters like the application name and port, the location of the definition of the Dapr components, and the command line to run your application. It looks something like this for a .NET application.

```powershell
dapr run --app-id dapr-service --resources-path ../../dapr/components/ --app-port 5190 -- dotnet run --project .
```

How can you debug your application? It is the Dapr sidecar that is starting your application. You want to attach the debugger to your application, not to the Dapr sidecar. You can use the IDE `Attach to process` feature. This is not convenient, but it works.

# Debugging Dapr application a better way

Another way is to leverage `Debugger.Launch()` and nest it in a `#if DEBUG` C# preprocessor directive. This way, the code is compiled only when you are in debug mode. Place those three lines in your application entry point. A good place is in the `Program.cs` file.

```csharp
#if DEBUG
Debugger.Launch();
#endif
```

`Debugger.Launch()`, as its name implies, will launch and attach a debugger to the process.

## Solution for Rider and Visual Studio

In Rider and Visual Studio, you can leverage the `launchSettings.json` and add one entry to its `profiles` to run the Dapr CLI command and your application.

```json
    "dapr": {
      "commandName": "Executable",
      "workingDirectory": "$(ProjectDir)",
      "executablePath": "dapr.exe",
      "commandLineArgs": "run --app-id dapr-service --resources-path ../dapr/components/ --app-port 5190 -- dotnet run --project ."
    }
```

It is nice to note that we can use MSBuild properties like `$(ProjectDir)` to define the project path as the working directory. 

The good thing about that approach is that **this can be shared in a team through the source control system**. You can also use the `launchSettings.json` to run your application without Dapr with another profile.

```json
    "http": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5190",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    }
```

Now you can run your application with Dapr or without Dapr using the IDE Run/Debug configuration.

## Debugging configuration for Rider

We need to set Rider as the default debugger. We can do that by going to _Settings_ and then _Build, Execution, Deployment_ and then _Debugger_. In the popping dialog, click the button _Set Rider as the default debugger_ and follow the instructions.

![Set Rider As Default Debugger](/images/SetRiderAsDefaultDebugger.png)

Now, we can select the Run/Debug configuration **Service: dapr** and either Run (CTRL+F5) or Debug (F5).

![RiderRunDebugConfiguration.png](/images/RiderRunDebugConfiguration.png)

Or press the CTRL key two times to use Rider Run Anything. Then type `dapr` to select the Run/Debug configuration.

![Rider Run Anything](/images/RiderRunAnything.png)

The Dapr sidecar starts, the sidecar starts your application, and the Rider _Just-ln-Time Debugger_ dialog popups. Select your project and tick _Remember executable in solution_. This creates a new run configuration in the selected solution with the target executable. Next time, if a solution is open with such a run configuration, this solution will be chosen automatically. Meaning that from the second time you start with the Dapr profile, you won't even see the Rider _Just-ln-Time Debugger_ dialog.

After that, click the Select _Button_, and the debugger will be attached to the process and will break on the line `Debugger.Launch()`, and you can happily debug your application ðŸ˜ƒ.

On the next debugging session, the _Just-ln-Time Debugger_ dialog will not pop up anymore. You will be able to debug your application directly.

Dapr sidecar and application outputs are displayed in the Rider Debug Output window if started in Debug. Or, in the Rider Run Console if started without Debug. That is fantastic because you do not need to switch between windows to see the outputs.

## Debugging configuration for Visual Studio

<Alert mode="warning">
If you set Rider as the default debugger, you need to reset those settings from the Rider settings dialog.
</Alert>

In Visual Studio, you can select the _Launch profile_ **dapr** and **must use Run (CTRL+F5)**. 

![VSRunConfiguration.png](/images/VSRunConfiguration.png)

A command window will open, followed by the Visual Studio _Choose Just-ln-Time Debugger_ dialog. Select your project from the _Available Debuggers_. 

![vsjitdebugger.png](/images/vsjitdebugger.png)

You will hit then also the `Debugger.Launch()` breakpoint, and you can debug your application.

![Visual Studio Debugger Launch Hit](/images/VSDebuggerLaunchHit.png)

There are two drawbacks to Visual Studio
1. The _Choose Just-ln-Time Debugger_ dialog will open every time, and you must select the project each time.
2. A shell window will open on your desktop.

## Alternative solution for Rider

Using Rider, you can create a _Shell Script_ Run/Debug configuration.

![Rider Run/Debug Configuration Shell](/images/RiderRunDebugConfigurationShell.png)

Using _Script text_ specifying the Dapr CLI command to run the application. We set the _Working directory_ to the directory in which the service is located. And we define the Run/Debug _Name_ as **dapr**. Finally, we tick _Store as project file_ to share this run configuration with other developers.

![Rider Dapr ScriptText](/images/RiderDaprScriptText.png)

We can select and start the `dapr` Run/Debug configuration. The Dapr sidecar will start, and the application will start. Then debugger will be attached to the process, and we can debug our application ðŸ˜€.

# Conclusion

In this post, we have seen how to debug a Dapr application. We have seen that we can use `Debugger.Launch()` and nest it in a `#if DEBUG` C# preprocessor directive. We have seen that we can use the `launchSettings.json` to run our application with Dapr or without Dapr. We have seen how to configure Rider and Visual Studio to debug our application with Dapr.
