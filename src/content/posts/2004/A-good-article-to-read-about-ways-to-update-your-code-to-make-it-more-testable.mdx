It is about ways to change your coding so that your code is more testable but it is also a good reminder about good design. I really liked the [article](http://www.theserverside.net/articles/showarticle.tss?id=10WaysTestableCode), nice work [Justin](http://www.gehtland.com/).


* Use Interfaces
* Define a base test class
* As much as feasible, make everything return a value
* Separate data access from business logic
* Make use of configuration
* Make Your Classes Do Only One Thing
* Have Domain Object Factories
* Think carefully about packaging, assemblies and namespaces
* Pick a logging strategy early


{/* <!-- more --> */}
Did I miss one or it is just 9 and not 10 like in the title of the article: [10 Ways to Make Your Code More Testable](http://www.theserverside.net/articles/showarticle.tss?id=10WaysTestableCode).
