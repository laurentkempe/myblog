[Microsoft Notebook: Top exec shares business lessons](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/200538_msftnotebook22.html)

* **It's often better to cannibalize your own business than to give someone else an opportunity to do it.**
* **In some situations, your biggest competition is yourself.**
* **One of the best ways to compete is to bet big on a "paradigm shift."**
* **When you dominate a market and you're looking for ways to grow, adjust your thinking to enlarge the potential market you're pursuing.**
* **Keep your mind open to unexpected opportunity.**
