I wanted today to display the application version in front of our builds, something I already did on the past but never with the VCS version.

In fact I used the same [BUILD_VCS_NUMBER_&lt;simplified VCS root name&gt;](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/TCD4/Predefined+Properties) that I described here: [Build multiple ClickOnce deployment packages using MSBuild and Team City](http://weblogs.asp.net/lkempe/archive/2009/11/03/build-multiple-clickonce-deployment-packages-using-msbuild-and-team-city.aspx)
{/* <!-- more --> */}

To implement this, go to the General Settings of your build and adapt as follows:

When your software is built, it will now display the version:
