Today I was listening and some time watching (it helps to have two monitors :) the following video that I got from [JetBrains blog](http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/) post, [Vaclav Pech Talking at JAX 2010](http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/2010/05/vaclav-pech-talking-at-jax-2010/)

I learned several tips and I think this video shows why I like more and more IntelliJ.
